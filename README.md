# Business case context
My company wanted to execute a dumping strategy in the FX market to increase its market share in Argentina. This initiative was closely connected with the marketing team, which was leading a strong campaign with the slogan 'the best price in the market.'

To make this possible, the C-level executives asked me to create a complex network of scrapers to monitor all our competitors and ensure that we offered the prices we were claiming. To achieve this, I developed 21 scrapers designed to track each of our competitors in the Argentine market. During development, I discovered that two of them did not have a public website for scraping, so I needed to create a mobile emulator to run their app on my server, log in, navigate, and ultimately extract the information needed.

All the compiled information was later shared with the entire company through a simple Flask website, providing us with a straightforward dashboard to monitor the market.

As a result of these developments, my company succeeded in capturing around 20% of the country's market share, which is one of my career achievements. This knowledge has also been applied to other RPA developments I have undertaken.
